# Data Visualization Kaggle Course

Welcome to my learning repository for the Kaggle Data Visualization Course. In this course, I learned how to create effective visualizations using Python's Seaborn library. The course is broken down into eight lessons that cover different topics related to data visualization.


## Course Overview

The course consists of the following lessons:

Each lesson contains a combination of tutorials and exercises to help you master the material.


## Repository Contents

The exercises folder contains the exercise files for the lesson, and the README.md file contains notes and comments on the lesson and my solutions.
