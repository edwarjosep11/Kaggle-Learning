# Kaggle Intermediate Machine Learning Course

Welcome to my learning repository for the Kaggle Intermediate Machine Learning course. This repository contains my solutions and exercises for the course, which covers building machine learning models for real-world datasets.

## Course Overview
The course consists of six lessons covering the following topics:

* Introduction
* Missing Values
* Categorical Variables
* Pipelines
* Cross-Validation
* XGBoost
* Data Leakage


Each lesson contains a combination of tutorials, exercises, and discussions to help you master the material.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains my solutions and exercises for each lesson. Each lesson is contained in its own folder, with the following structure:

* Exercises/: Contains the exercise files for the lesson.
* Solutions/: Contains my solutions to the exercises.
* README.md: Contains notes and comments on the lesson and my solutions.

## Topics Covered
The Intermediate Machine Learning course covers a range of topics related to building machine learning models for real-world datasets. Some of the key topics covered include:

* Handling missing values in datasets.
* Working with categorical variables in machine learning models.
* Building pipelines to automate the machine learning process.
* Using cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
* Building gradient boosting models with XGBoost.
* Detecting and fixing data leakage in machine learning pipelines.
