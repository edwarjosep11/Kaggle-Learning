# Kaggle Feature Engineering Course
Welcome to my learning repository for the Kaggle Feature Engineering Course. In this course, I learned how to create better features from raw data to improve the predictive performance of machine learning models. The course is composed of six lessons that cover different topics related to feature engineering.


## Course Overview
The course consists of the following lessons:

* What Is Feature Engineering
* Mutual Information
* Creating Features
* Clustering With K-Means
* Principal Component Analysis
* Target Encoding


Each lesson contains video lectures, quizzes, and exercises to help you master the material.


## Repository Contents
This repository contains my solutions and exercises for each lesson. Each lesson is contained in its own folder, with the following structure:

* Exercises
* README File


The exercises folder contains the exercise files for the lesson, and the README.md file contains notes and comments on the lesson and my solutions.

## Certificate
I have completed 100% of the course and obtained a [Certificate](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/edwarj/feature-engineering) of completion for the Kaggle Feature Engineering Course.
