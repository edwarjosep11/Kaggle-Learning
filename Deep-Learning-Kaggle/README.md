# Kaggle: Computer Vision
Welcome to my learning repository for the Kaggle Computer Vision course. This repository contains my solutions and exercises for the course, which covers building convolutional neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Course Overview
The course consists of six lessons covering the following topics:

* The Convolutional Classifier
* Convolution and ReLU
* Maximum Pooling
* The Sliding Window
* Custom Convnets
* Data Augmentation


Each lesson contains a combination of tutorials, exercises, and discussions to help you master the material.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains my solutions and exercises for each lesson. Each lesson is contained in its own folder, with the following structure:

* Exercises.
* README File.


The exercises folder contains the exercise files for the lesson, and the solutions folder contains my solutions. The README.md file contains notes and comments on the lesson and my solutions.

## Certificate
I have completed 100% of the course and obtained a certificate of completion for the Computer Vision course.
