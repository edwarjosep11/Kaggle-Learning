# Intro to Deep Learning Course
Welcome to my learning repository for the Intro to Deep Learning course. This repository contains my solutions and exercises for the course, which covers using TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural networks for structured data.

## Course Overview
The course consists of six lessons covering the following topics:

* A Single Neuron
* Deep Neural Networks
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Overfitting and Underfitting
* Dropout and Batch Normalization
* Binary Classification


Each lesson contains a combination of tutorials, exercises, and discussions to help you master the material.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains my solutions and exercises for each lesson. Each lesson is contained in its own folder, with the following structure:

* Exercises.
* README File.


The exercises folder contains the exercise files for the lesson, and the solutions folder contains my solutions. The README.md file contains notes and comments on the lesson and my solutions.

## Certificate
I have completed 100% of the course and obtained a certificate of completion for the Intro to Deep Learning course.
